### MirOS
MirOS BSD is a secure operating system from the BSD family for 32-bit i386 and sparc systems. It is based on 4.4BSD-Lite (mostly OpenBSD, some NetBSD®). The MirPorts Framework is a portable ports tree to facilitate the installation of additional software. The project also releases some portable software: mksh, a pdksh-based shell; PaxMirabilis, an archiver for various formats; MirMake, a framework for building software; MirNroff, an AT&T nroff based man page (and text document) formatter; MirCksum, a flexible checksumming and hash generation tool; and some more.

### NetBSD
NetBSD is a free, fast, secure, and highly portable Unix-like Open Source operating system. It is available for a wide range of platforms, from large-scale servers and powerful desktop systems to handheld and embedded devices. Its clean design and advanced features make it excellent for use in both production and research environments, and the source code is freely available under a business-friendly license. NetBSD is developed and supported by a large and vivid international community. Many applications are readily available through pkgsrc, the NetBSD Packages Collection.

### NextBSD
NextBSD is a code name for "science project", a name which is more tongue-in-cheek than serious (naming projects is hard). It started as an effort to adapt some of the more interesting Open Source technologies from Darwin/OS X to FreeBSD.

### OpenBSD
The OpenBSD project produces a FREE, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system.

### SmallWall
A long time ago, a very smart guy asked a very simple question. "Why do firewalls have to be big, slow, and hard to configure?" And he created m0n0wall.At this, it was amazingly successful. So successful that the FreeBSD based core was used as a basis for several other projects such as pfSense, Askozia, FreeNAS, and nas4free. Recently, a grandchild of m0n0wall was spawned from pfSense, OPNSense. But, m0n0wall has retired now, and some of us still feel the need for a small and lean firewall. SmallWall is that firewall.
