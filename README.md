### NetBSD
NetBSD is a free, fast, secure, and highly portable Unix-like Open Source operating system. It is available for a wide range of platforms, from large-scale servers and powerful desktop systems to handheld and embedded devices. Its clean design and advanced features make it excellent for use in both production and research environments, and the source code is freely available under a business-friendly license. NetBSD is developed and supported by a large and vivid international community. Many applications are readily available through pkgsrc, the NetBSD Packages Collection.

### OpenBSD
The OpenBSD project produces a FREE, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system.

### SmallWall
A long time ago, a very smart guy asked a very simple question. "Why do firewalls have to be big, slow, and hard to configure?" And he created m0n0wall.At this, it was amazingly successful. So successful that the FreeBSD based core was used as a basis for several other projects such as pfSense, Askozia, FreeNAS, and nas4free. Recently, a grandchild of m0n0wall was spawned from pfSense, OPNSense. But, m0n0wall has retired now, and some of us still feel the need for a small and lean firewall. SmallWall is that firewall.
