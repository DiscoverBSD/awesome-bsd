###MirOS

MirOS BSD is a secure operating system from the BSD family for 32-bit i386 and sparc systems. It is based on 4.4BSD-Lite (mostly OpenBSD, some NetBSD®). The MirPorts Framework is a portable ports tree to facilitate the installation of additional software. The project also releases some portable software: mksh, a pdksh-based shell; PaxMirabilis, an archiver for various formats; MirMake, a framework for building software; MirNroff, an AT&T nroff based man page (and text document) formatter; MirCksum, a flexible checksumming and hash generation tool; and some more.

### OpenBSD
The OpenBSD project produces a FREE, multi-platform 4.4BSD-based UNIX-like operating system. Our efforts emphasize portability, standardization, correctness, [proactive security](http://www.openbsd.org/security.html) and [integrated cryptography](http://www.openbsd.org/crypto.html). As an example of the effect OpenBSD has, the popular [OpenSSH](http://www.openssh.com/) software comes from OpenBSD.

###RaspBSD
RaspBSD is a image of FreeBSD 11 that is preconfigured in two different images for Raspberry Pi Computers (and more soon).
* [official site](http://raspbsd.org)

###SmallWall
A long time ago, a very smart guy asked a very simple question. "Why do firewalls have to be big, slow, and hard to configure?" And he created m0n0wall.At this, it was amazingly successful. So successful that the FreeBSD based core was used as a basis for several other projects such as pfSense, Askozia, FreeNAS, and nas4free. Recently, a grandchild of m0n0wall was spawned from pfSense, OPNSense. But, m0n0wall has retired now, and some of us still feel the need for a small and lean firewall. SmallWall is that firewall.
